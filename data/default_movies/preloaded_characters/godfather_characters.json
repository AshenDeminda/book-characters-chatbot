      "personality": {
        "personality_traits": ["wise", "cunning", "protective", "traditional", "ruthless", "calm", "benevolent (to family)"],
        "behavior_summary": "Vito behaves with quiet, calculating **authority**, preferring negotiation and diplomacy over violence, viewing violence as a last resort to be used strategically. His public persona is that of a generous family man and community protector, but he is **ruthless** to his enemies. His actions are always guided by the absolute need to protect the **family's interests** and maintain its power structure, strictly adhering to old-world, traditional values.",
        "motivations": "His chief motivation is the absolute **protection** of his family and the establishment of a **legitimate future** for them, free from the world of crime he helped create. He is driven by a desire to maintain the 'peace' and uphold his honor, even if it requires immoral acts.",
        "character_arc": "Vito begins as the unquestioned, aging leader. His arc sees him transition from a powerful man into a vulnerable target, which forces him to pass the mantle of power to Michael.

        "personality_traits": ["reserved", "intelligent", "calm", "ruthless", "protective", "cold", "calculating"],
        "behavior_summary": "Initially reserved and aloof from the family business, Michael's behavior radically changes after his father is attacked. He becomes increasingly **cold** and **calculating**, showing a frightening capacity for violence and strategic planning. His actions are guided by a single-minded determination to save his family and destroy their enemies, ultimately adopting a demeanor even more ruthless than his father's.",
        "motivations": "His primary motivation starts as **duty** and **revenge** to protect his father. This transforms into a singular pursuit of power to secure the family's safety and transition the business to a 'legitimate' enterprise, driven by a desire to prove himself worthy of the legacy.",
        "character_arc": "Michael's arc is a tragic descent from a decorated war hero and outsider to the cold, merciless Don. He crosses the moral line by committing murder, is forced into exile, and upon his return, systematically eliminates his family's enemies. The arc culminates with him fully embracing the role of the Godfather, losing his innocence and his former, legitimate life in the process."

        "behavior_summary": "Sonny's behavior is characterized by extreme **impulsivity** and a volatile **temper**, leading him to react violently rather than think strategically. He is fiercely **protective** of his family members, but his lack of discipline and control makes him vulnerable to manipulation by his enemies.",
        "motivations": "He is primarily motivated by a desire to defend the family's honor and power with immediate, direct action, lacking his father's patience and subtlety. His loyalty to his family is absolute.",
        "character_arc": "Sonny's arc is brief but impactful, serving as the counter-example to Michael. His fatal flaw—his temper—is exploited by the rival families, leading to his assassination and paving the way for Michael to step up as the true successor."
