        "behavior_summary": "Holmes’s behavior is marked by extreme **detachment** and strict adherence to **pure logic and scientific method**. He appears erratic or moody when inactive, resorting to violin playing or cocaine use to stimulate his mind. When on a case, he exhibits relentless energy and profound focus, treating crime as a fascinating intellectual puzzle. He shows emotional concern only when a case involves great injustice or the safety of a friend.",
        "motivations": "His core motivation is an insatiable **thirst for intellectual stimulation** and the challenge of solving impossible cases, viewing himself as the world's only consulting detective.

The pursuit of the ultimate intellectual challenge, represented by Moriarty, is a major lifelong driver.",

        "motivations": "Watson is motivated by his deep **admiration and affection for Holmes**, finding the adventure and intellectual challenge necessary to keep his mind active after his military service.

        "motivations": "Her primary motivation is simply to maintain her livelihood and the domestic order of 221B Baker Street. She is also motivated by a quiet **affection and admiration for Holmes**, enduring his eccentricities because she respects his genius and kindness, demonstrating a quiet loyalty to her unusual tenants.",
