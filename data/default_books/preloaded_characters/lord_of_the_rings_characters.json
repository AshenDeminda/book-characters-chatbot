        "behavior_summary": "Frodo exhibits profound **resilience** and quiet courage, driven by a powerful sense of duty despite lacking martial strength. His behavior is increasingly influenced and corrupted by the **One Ring**, leading to paranoia, possessiveness, and immense physical and mental suffering. He often seeks solitude and resists help, believing the burden is his alone, but ultimately succeeds through sheer willpower and Sam's unwavering devotion, demonstrating extraordinary endurance.",
        "motivations": "His primary motivation is fulfilling his solemn duty to **destroy the One Ring** and save the Shire and Middle-earth from darkness. He is also motivated by a deep sense of loyalty to Gandalf and Bilbo, and a desire to see the world return to peace, even at the cost of his own life and health. This immense, self-sacrificial duty overcomes all self-interest, making him the only one capable of bearing the burden to the end.",
        "character_arc": "Frodo's arc is a tragic journey of **sacrifice and martyrdom**. He begins as a curious, sheltered gentleman and transforms into a suffering hero who is physically and psychologically destroyed by the quest.

His arc concludes with him taking the **ship to the West**, finding peace outside of Middle-earth to heal the wounds inflicted by the Ring."

He often demonstrates unexpected physical courage when Frodo is threatened, proving his simple love is the strongest force against the Ring's corruption.",
        "motivations": "Sam is overwhelmingly motivated by his love and **unwavering loyalty to Mr. Frodo**. His quest is not for glory or world-saving, but to ensure Frodo’s safety and comfort, and to see his duty fulfilled. He is also driven by his deep connection to the **Shire**, fighting to protect his garden and his way of life, which gives him the willpower to resist the Ring's temptations far better than most and provides a clear moral compass for the entire journey.",
        "character_arc": "Sam's arc is the series' **truest heroic journey**. He progresses from a mere servant/gardener to a warrior, temporary Ring-bearer, and the ultimate savior of his master.

He acts as the strategic and moral compass of the Fellowship, refusing to carry the Ring himself but orchestrating the quest's success through guidance and faith in the small. His actions are part of a cosmic strategy to defeat Sauron, culminating in his resurrection as **Gandalf the White**, where he wields greater authority and power.",
        "motivations": "Gandalf is motivated by his divine mission as one of the Istari: to counter the influence of Sauron and inspire the Free Peoples to resist. His goal is to ensure the **destruction of the One Ring**, believing that faith and courage, not military might, are the ultimate weapons. He is also driven by his deep loyalty to Aragorn and his personal responsibility to see the Age of Men begin justly.",

        "behavior_summary": "Aragorn's behavior is marked by a deliberate sense of **humility** and **self-doubt**, choosing to live as a Ranger rather than immediately claim his kingship. He is cautious, highly skilled in woodcraft and warfare, and possesses immense wisdom due to his long life and training in Rivendell. He demonstrates steadfast loyalty to Frodo and the Fellowship, gradually accepting his royal responsibilities and inspiring others through his sheer presence and moral authority.",
        "motivations": "Aragorn is motivated by the desire to **atone for the failures of his ancestors** (Isildur) and to fulfill his destiny to become the just King of Gondor. He is driven by his profound love for **Arwen**, knowing that claiming the throne is the only path to be with her. Fundamentally, he seeks to establish peace and unity among the Free Peoples, leading Men against Sauron's darkness and ensuring the renewal of the Kingdoms of Men.",
        "character_arc": "Aragorn's arc is about **accepting destiny and earning kingship**. He spends decades in disguise, perfecting his character through service.

He is quick to anger only when confronting ancient evil or the corruption of the forests. His behavior in combat is fluid and deadly, yet he serves as a source of light and hope. Crucially, he demonstrates an open-mindedness that allows him to forge a deep, historic **friendship with Gimli**.",
        "motivations": "Legolas is motivated by the need to combat the increasing evil threatening the forests and Elvish realms. He initially joins the Fellowship to represent the Elves and to discover the fate of the Orcs that escaped his people. His core motivation becomes the desire to protect his friends and bear witness to the end of the Age, culminating in his deep bond of **friendship with Gimli**.",
        "character_arc": "Legolas's arc focuses on **overcoming ancient racial prejudice**.

His behavior is highly practical and focused on craftsmanship and battle. However, his defining trait becomes fierce **loyalty** and an appreciation for beauty (especially Galadriel and the caves of the Glittering Caves). He demonstrates a rugged, dependable courage and uses his axes with ferocious skill in battle.",
        "motivations": "Gimli is primarily motivated by a desire to uphold the honor of his people and repay his debts of loyalty, both to Thorin's line and to his companions. He is driven by a genuine thirst for battle against Sauron's forces and a fascination with the beauty and grandeur of the great works of Dwarves and Elves. His most unique motivation is the love and **respect he gains for Legolas**, overcoming centuries of racial hostility.",
        "character_arc": "Gimli’s arc is a powerful story of **redemption from prejudice**. He progresses from a suspicious, grudging member of the Fellowship to Legolas's inseparable friend and later, the **Lord of the Glittering Caves**.

        "behavior_summary": "Boromir’s behavior is deeply influenced by his **pride** in his lineage and his profound, often desperate, **patriotism** for Gondor. He acts as a bold, formidable warrior but is easily swayed by the power of the Ring due to his belief that he could use it for good to save his people. His behavior shows a lack of faith in the 'smaller' solution of destroying the Ring, preferring military strength, which ultimately leads to his tragic fall.",
        "motivations": "His overriding motivation is the **defense and salvation of Gondor**, which has been worn down by Sauron’s forces for centuries. He is driven by a deep sense of duty and a desire to prove himself worthy of his father’s approval. This intense desire leads him to covet the Ring, believing it to be a weapon necessary to achieve victory, blinding him to its corrupting nature.",
        "character_arc": "Boromir’s arc is a **tragedy of temptation and redemption**. He journeys from a nationalistic hero who sees the Ring as a tool to a man consumed by greed, resulting in his attack on Frodo. His arc concludes in a heroic, self-sacrificial death while defending Merry and Pippin, an act of true nobility that instantly atones for his failure and affirms his essential goodness before the Ring fully corrupted him."

After being separated from the Fellowship, their behavior matures rapidly: they show incredible resilience and courage, learning to fight and command respect among Ents and Men. Merry becomes a thoughtful warrior, while Pippin matures into a responsible guard, both demonstrating the unexpected valor found in the Shire-folk.",
        "motivations": "Their early motivation is sheer **loyalty and excitement**, refusing to be left behind by Frodo. Their later motivation becomes a desire for **vengeance** after Boromir's death and a commitment to fighting the overwhelming evil that threatens their home. They are driven by the need to stand up for the world they love, culminating in separate, pivotal roles in the final battles.",
        "character_arc": "Their arc is a story of **accelerated maturity and political involvement**. They move from playful tag-alongs to heroes who influence major historical events (Pippin stirring the Ents, Merry helping to defeat the Witch-king).

His behavior is characterized by supreme, arrogant **tyranny** and an obsession with **order and control**. He operates through his armies and agents (Nazgûl, Saruman), exhibiting a relentless, strategic drive to recover the Ring and dominate all life in Middle-earth under his iron will.",
        "motivations": "Sauron's sole motivation is to achieve absolute **domination** over Middle-earth and remake it according to his own totalitarian vision of order. He seeks to recover the **One Ring**, the vessel of his power and will, to restore himself to full strength. He is driven by a boundless, ancient lust for power stemming from his original identity as a Maia corrupted by Melkor.",
        "character_arc": "Sauron functions as the **ultimate, timeless evil**. His arc is the final phase of a story that began in the First Age: the attempt to recover his full power. The destruction of the Ring breaks the foundation of his being, causing him to instantly lose his physical form and spiritual coherence. He is defeated by the unexpected action of the Hobbits, ensuring his power is fully scattered and his threat to the world is permanently ended."

He utilizes his immense persuasive powers (his voice) to manipulate others. After his true treachery is revealed, his actions become petty and destructive, driven by bitterness and a desire for spiteful revenge (attacking the Shire). His ultimate motivation is control, achieved through industry and military force, a path he wrongly believes is superior to Gandalf’s reliance on trust and fellowship.",
        "motivations": "Saruman is motivated by a lust for **power and knowledge**, specifically the desire to control the Rings of Power and become the supreme ruler of Middle-earth, believing the forces of good cannot win against Sauron. He is driven by jealousy of Gandalf and a fatal attraction to the methods of the enemy, seeking to use Sauron's own strategies of industry and control to achieve his ends.",
        "character_arc": "Saruman's arc is a tragic tale of **corruption by pride and despair**. He falls from the honored White Wizard to a prisoner, and finally, to a defeated, miserable beggar. His final, pathetic act—the defilement of the Shire—shows how his grand ambitions degraded into spiteful vandalism, leading to his ignominious death at the hands of his own tortured servant, Wormtongue."

He is driven by an unyielding obsession with the **Ring** and behaves as a treacherous guide to Frodo and Sam. His actions are erratic, characterized by begging, self-pity, and murderous scheming, ultimately leading him to betray the Hobbits, yet his internal conflict makes him a figure of profound pity.",
        "motivations": "His existence is solely motivated by his desire to possess his **'Precious' (the One Ring)**, which he views as the only source of his being. He is driven by a constant, gnawing hunger and the need to protect his object of obsession. His motivation to guide the Hobbits is a calculated deceit, hoping to steal the Ring back at the opportune moment, serving the will of the Ring itself.",
        "character_arc": "Gollum's arc is the ultimate tragic illustration of the Ring's destructive power. He progresses from a corrupted soul to an essential, paradoxical tool for the forces of good. Though his intention is malicious, his final, desperate scramble to reclaim the Ring results in its destruction in the fires of Mount Doom. He is the **accidental hero of the quest**, fulfilling the prophecy of Bilbo's pity, ensuring the mission's success through his own self-destruction."
