        "behavior_summary": "Dumbledore's public behavior is marked by a blend of genial eccentricity and profound wisdom, often dispensing cryptic advice. His true nature, however, is that of a brilliant but **morally flawed strategist**. Driven by deep **remorse** over his early life, he orchestrates events and manipulates people, including Harry, for the greater good. He is secretive, believing certain truths are too dangerous for others to know, and consistently places the long-term safety of the world above the immediate happiness or peace of individuals, even planning his own death to serve the cause.",
        "motivations": "His primary motivation is **atonement** for his youth, particularly his involvement with Gellert Grindelwald and his earlier ambition for power over Muggles. He is driven to defeat Voldemort at any cost, using his intelligence to protect the innocent and ensure the **triumph of love** over hatred. He seeks to guide Harry to his final destiny, recognizing that only Harry possesses the key to salvation, and works relentlessly to maintain the secrets necessary to ensure this outcome.",
        "character_arc": "Dumbledore's arc is one of self-imposed penance. He goes from a brilliant but power-hungry youth who sought to dominate Muggles to the ultimate symbol of good, forced to live with the knowledge of his past darkness.

        "behavior_summary": "Snape's behavior is a bitter facade of sarcasm, hostility, and thinly veiled contempt, specifically aimed at Harry and his friends, mirroring the Marauders' behavior towards him in his youth. His true nature is revealed as one of extraordinary, self-sacrificing **courage** and unwavering **loyalty** to a single vow. He endures constant danger as a double agent, maintaining his cover through sheer magical talent and emotional fortitude. Every action, even his cruelty towards Harry, is a calculated risk to protect his mission and uphold his promise to Dumbledore.",
        "motivations": "Snape's sole, all-consuming motivation is his **unrequited love for Lily Evans Potter**, which drives his lifelong commitment to protect her son, Harry. This act is a form of atonement for his role in her death. He is also motivated by his vow to Albus Dumbledore and his hatred of Lord Voldemort, whom he despises for destroying the one person he ever truly cared about. This motivation is the ultimate secret that defines his life.",
        "character_arc": "Snape's arc is perhaps the most tragic and complex. He goes from a bullied schoolboy who embraces the Dark Arts out of alienation to a Death Eater, and then transforms into Dumbledore's most trusted spy. His journey is one of immense self-loathing, redemption through secret service, and ultimate sacrifice. He never receives credit for his heroism, dying under the pretense of being a villain, his memory becoming a testament to the powerful, enduring nature of selfless love."

        "personality_traits": ["kind", "loyal", "emotional", "naïve", "brave", "protective", "blunt", "clumsy"],
        "behavior_summary": "Hagrid's massive physical presence is completely at odds with his profoundly gentle and sentimental nature. His behavior is characterized by overwhelming, protective **kindness** and unwavering **trust** in those he loves. He is often **naïve** about the danger of his beloved monstrous creatures, which occasionally causes chaos. However, he is the most consistent and stable emotional anchor for Harry, acting as a true father figure whose loyalty to Harry and Dumbledore never falters, even when facing mortal danger.",
        "motivations": "His main motivation is to serve and protect the two people who showed him unwavering faith: **Albus Dumbledore** and **Harry Potter**. He is deeply motivated by a desire to gain **acceptance** and show the worth of half-giants and other marginalized creatures in the Wizarding World. This desire is often channeled into his passionate, though often dangerous, care for magical animals, which he sees as equally misunderstood.",
        "character_arc": "Hagrid begins his life as an outcast, unjustly expelled from Hogwarts, hiding his half-giant heritage. His arc is one of **vindication** and **acceptance**. He is eventually cleared of his earlier charge and becomes a respected professor, fully integrated into the Hogwarts community. His final, most poignant act—carrying Harry's seemingly lifeless body out of the Forbidden Forest—symbolizes the beginning and the emotional backbone of Harry's entire journey, confirming his role as the ultimate, steadfast guardian."

        "behavior_summary": "Sirius's behavior is often marked by an understandable **recklessness** and **impulsivity**, stemming from twelve years of unjust imprisonment and a desperate desire to make up for lost time with Harry. He is fiercely protective of his godson, often placing himself in danger and clashing with the authority figures in the Order of the Phoenix, particularly Dumbledore. He carries the **trauma** of his past, sometimes confusing Harry with his old friend, James, but his deep-seated loyalty to his friends remains his defining trait.",
        "motivations": "His primary motivation is to serve as a proper **guardian** and **father figure** to Harry, an opportunity stolen from him by Peter Pettigrew. He is also driven by a desperate need for **freedom** and a desire to return to active service in the fight against Voldemort. He seeks to clear his name and live up to the memory of his best friends, committing himself wholeheartedly to the cause of the Order of the Phoenix.",
        "character_arc": "Sirius's arc is a tragic story of **redemption interrupted**. He transforms from a fugitive consumed by bitterness and the trauma of Azkaban into a loving, if flawed, mentor figure for Harry.

        "behavior_summary": "Voldemort's behavior is entirely governed by his **pathological fear of death**, leading him to commit atrocious acts like the creation of **Horcruxes** to splinter his soul. He is a genius manipulator, capable of charming others, but utterly incapable of understanding or experiencing **love, friendship, or remorse**. His actions are calculated for maximum terror and control. He is supremely arrogant, consistently underestimating the power of abstract concepts like love and sacrifice, which ultimately leads to his catastrophic downfall.",
        "motivations": "His singular motivation is to achieve **absolute immortality** and **ultimate magical power**. He is driven by a deep hatred for his own Muggle origins and a narcissistic need to prove his superiority through blood purity and dominance.
